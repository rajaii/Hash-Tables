research djb2 hash and check if it is ok
do insert and remove:
insert:


hash the key

if at capacity, resize else just add to the storage

add to count


if collisions return error else
return storage

Done still need to handle collisions and logic for resize and check if it works on insert

remove:



resize:
make capacity * 2
makenew storage
