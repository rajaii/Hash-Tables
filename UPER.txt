research djb2 hash and check if it is ok
do insert and remove:
insert:


hash the key

if at capacity, resize else just add to the storage

add to count


if collisions return error else
return storage

Done still need to handle collisions and logic for resize and check if it works on insert

remove:



resize:
make capacity * 2
makenew storage

Day 2:

handle collisions in insert and do resize method

insert:
if index is taken, traverse linked pair and add next value to end of pair:
    pointer points to new k,v pair, which itself points to none



handle all cases where more than 1 pair in lp


maybe 170 and 166 in resize needs a nested if for if the new hashes overlap again
